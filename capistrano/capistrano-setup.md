Capistrano is a popular deployment tool used primarily for web applications, including Ruby on Rails applications. It automates the process of deploying applications to one or more servers, allowing for a reliable, repeatable, and scriptable deployment environment. Below are the general steps for deploying a Rails application using Capistrano:

### Step 1: Install Capistrano

First, add Capistrano to your Gemfile in the Rails application:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'capistrano', require: false
  gem 'capistrano-rails', require: false
  gem 'capistrano-rbenv', '~> 2.1', require: false  # if you are using rbenv
  gem 'capistrano-bundler', require: false
  gem 'capistrano3-puma', require: false  # if you are using Puma as a web server
end
```

Then, run `bundle install` to install these gems.

### Step 2: Capify Your Application

Initialize Capistrano in your application by running:

```bash
cap install
```

This command creates several configuration files and directories in your project:
- `Capfile` in your root directory.
- `config/deploy.rb` for main configuration.
- `config/deploy/` directory, typically with a file for each stage (e.g., `production.rb`, `staging.rb`).

### Step 3: Configure Capistrano

Edit `Capfile` to include necessary libraries:

```ruby
# Capfile
require 'capistrano/setup'
require 'capistrano/deploy'
require 'capistrano/rbenv'    # If you are using rbenv
require 'capistrano/bundler'
require 'capistrano/rails/assets'  # For asset pipeline
require 'capistrano/rails/migrations'  # For running migrations
require 'capistrano/puma'    # If using Puma
```

Configure `config/deploy.rb` to specify global settings:

```ruby
# config/deploy.rb
set :application, 'my_app_name'
set :repo_url, 'git@example.com:me/my_repo.git'
set :deploy_to, '/var/www/my_app_name'
set :linked_files, fetch(:linked_files, []).push('config/database.yml', 'config/master.key')
set :linked_dirs, fetch(:linked_dirs, []).push('log', 'tmp/pids', 'tmp/cache', 'tmp/sockets', 'public/system', 'public/uploads')
set :keep_releases, 5
```

Configure each environment separately in `config/deploy/`, for example `config/deploy/production.rb`:

```ruby
# config/deploy/production.rb
server 'example.com', user: 'deploy', roles: %w{app db web}
set :branch, 'main'
```

### Step 4: Prepare Your Production Server

1. **Set up deployment directories** on your server.
2. **Ensure your deploy user** (`deploy` in this case) has the correct permissions and access to necessary directories.
3. **Setup SSH keys** for the deploy user so Capistrano can access the server without needing a password.
4. **Configure your web server and database** on the server. Ensure that `database.yml` and `master.key` are correctly placed in the shared directory on the server.

### Step 5: Deploy Your Application

Run the deployment with:

```bash
cap production deploy
```

Capistrano will connect to your server, update the code, run migrations, restart the web server, and more.

### Step 6: Verify Deployment

Check your application by accessing it through a web browser. Verify that everything is functioning as expected. Debug any issues by checking the Capistrano output and server logs.

### Optional Steps

- **Automate tasks** like restarting background workers or flushing cache post-deployment by adding custom tasks in `deploy.rb` or environment-specific files.
- **Secure your deployment** by making sure that only the necessary files are writable by the Capistrano deploy user.

Using Capistrano streamlines the deployment process for Rails applications and, once configured, provides a simple, repeatable deployment process.

Yes, you can certainly use an IP address instead of a domain name in your Capistrano configuration. The `server` directive in Capistrano is flexible and accepts either a domain name or an IP address to specify where your application should be deployed.

Here's how you can modify the line in your Capistrano deployment configuration to use an IP address:

```ruby
# config/deploy/production.rb
server '192.168.1.1', user: 'deploy', roles: %w{app db web}
```

In this example, replace `192.168.1.1` with the actual IP address of your server. This setup is common, especially in early stages of development or in environments where you might not yet have a domain set up.

### Key Considerations When Using an IP Address:

1. **SSH Access**: Ensure that the `deploy` user can SSH into the server using the specified IP address. You should set up SSH keys for authentication to facilitate a secure and smooth connection without the need for passwords.

2. **Firewall Settings**: Make sure that any firewalls or security groups associated with the server are configured to allow incoming connections from your location to the relevant ports (typically SSH on port 22).

3. **Roles Explained**:
    - `app`: This role typically handles the application code and runtime.
    - `db`: This role is for databases, often indicating tasks that might involve database migrations.
    - `web`: This role generally involves web server configurations and serving the actual web pages.

4. **Future Domain Use**: If you plan on assigning a domain name to this server in the future, you can easily update this configuration by replacing the IP address with your new domain name in the `server` line.

Using an IP address directly has no impact on the functionality of Capistrano or the deployment process other than the actual address used to reach your server. It's a perfectly valid method especially useful in testing and initial production setups. Once your deployment is confirmed to work via IP, transitioning to a domain name should be seamless.

If you're using a non-standard SSH port, such as 2222 instead of the default SSH port 22, you'll need to specify this port in your Capistrano configuration to ensure that Capistrano can connect to your server correctly.

Here's how you can modify the Capistrano `server` line to include the custom SSH port:

```ruby
# config/deploy/production.rb
server '192.168.1.1', user: 'deploy', roles: %w{app db web}, port: 2222
```

In this configuration:
- Replace `192.168.1.1` with your server's IP address.
- The `port: 2222` specifies that Capistrano should connect using SSH on port 2222.

### Additional Configurations and Considerations

1. **SSH Configurations**: To simplify your Capistrano configuration and management, you can also set this custom port in your SSH configuration file (`~/.ssh/config`) on your local machine. Hereâ€™s how you can add it:

    ```bash
    Host myserver
        HostName 192.168.1.1
        User deploy
        Port 2222
    ```

    Then in your Capistrano configuration, you can refer to the host alias:

    ```ruby
    # config/deploy/production.rb
    server 'myserver', roles: %w{app db web}
    ```

    This approach keeps your deployment script cleaner and centralizes SSH configurations in one place.

2. **Security**: Using a non-standard port can be a part of a security through obscurity strategy to reduce the exposure to automated attacks. Ensure that your firewall rules are updated to allow traffic on port 2222.

3. **Permissions**: As always, ensure that the `deploy` user has the necessary permissions on the server for deployment tasks, including directory access and script execution.

4. **Testing Connection**: Before running your Capistrano deployment, test the SSH connection from your local machine using the command:

    ```bash
    ssh deploy@192.168.1.1 -p 2222
    ```

    This command helps confirm that the SSH setup, including the custom port, is working as expected.

By setting up your deployment configuration to use the correct SSH port, you ensure that Capistrano can establish a connection to your server for deployment processes. This setup is crucial for a smooth and automated deployment flow.

The error you're encountering during the Capistrano deployment indicates that the underlying SSH library used by Capistrano (`net-ssh`) requires additional gems to support the `ssh-ed25519` key type, which is a modern and secure key algorithm. The gems `ed25519` and `bcrypt_pbkdf` are necessary for this support.

Here's how you can resolve this issue by installing the required gems:

### Step 1: Install the Required Gems

You need to install the `ed25519` and `bcrypt_pbkdf` gems. Run the following commands in your local environment or on any machine where you run Capistrano tasks:

```bash
gem install ed25519 --version '>= 1.2, < 2.0'
gem install bcrypt_pbkdf --version '>= 1.0, < 2.0'
```

### Step 2: Ensure Gem Visibility

If you encounter the `Gem::MissingSpecError` despite installing the gems, ensure that these gems are accessible in your gem path or properly included in your project's Gemfile if they are used during deployment. For a Rails project managed by Bundler, add these gems to your Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'ed25519', '>= 1.2', '< 2.0'
  gem 'bcrypt_pbkdf', '>= 1.0', '< 2.0'
end
```

Then run `bundle install` to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and managed by Bundler.

### Step 3: Verify Gem Installation

After installing the gems, you can verify their installation by running:

```bash
gem list | grep ed25519
gem list | grep bcrypt_pbkdf
```

This will show you the installed versions of these gems to confirm that they meet the required versions.

### Step 4: Retry Deployment

Once the necessary gems are installed, try running your Capistrano deployment again:

```bash
cap production deploy
```

### Additional Tips

- **Gem Path Issues**: If the gems are still not recognized, check your Ruby environment and gem paths by running `gem env`. This can help ensure that your environment is set up correctly and that gems are installed in a location accessible to your Ruby setup.
- **Permission Issues**: Make sure you have the proper permissions to install gems and access them. If using RVM or rbenv, ensure that they are configured correctly for your user account.
- **Deployment Environment**: Ensure that any remote servers or containers where deployment scripts run also have these gems installed if necessary, although typically, these gems are needed on the machine initiating the Capistrano tasks.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `NotImplementedError` related to `ssh-ed25519` key support and successfully deploy your Rails application using Capistrano.

The error `SSHKit::Runner::ExecuteError: Exception while executing as deploy@54.188.245.219: Authentication failed for user deploy@54.188.245.219` clearly indicates an SSH authentication issue. This problem typically arises when Capistrano tries to connect to your server but fails due to incorrect or missing SSH credentials.

Here are steps to troubleshoot and resolve SSH authentication issues for your Capistrano deployment:

### Step 1: Verify SSH Keys

Ensure that the SSH key for the `deploy` user is correctly set up on both your local machine and the server.

1. **Check Local SSH Key**: Make sure that you have an SSH key generated and loaded into your SSH agent on your local machine where you're running Capistrano.

    ```bash
    ssh-add -l  # List SSH keys that the agent is managing
    ```

    If your key isn't listed, you can add it using:

    ```bash
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa  # Assuming your private key is named id_rsa
    ```

2. **Copy SSH Key to Server**: Ensure that the public part of your SSH key is in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the server for the `deploy` user.

    ```bash
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub deploy@54.188.245.219 -p 2222
    ```

    This command will prompt you for the `deploy` user's password and copy your public key to the server's authorized keys.

### Step 2: Test SSH Connection

Test the SSH connection manually to ensure that you can connect without Capistrano:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 deploy@54.188.245.219
```

If this command fails, you won't be able to deploy using Capistrano either. This command helps you verify that the SSH setup itself is correct, independent of Capistrano.

### Step 3: Configure Capistrano

Verify that Capistrano is set to use the correct username, server IP, and port. This seems to be set correctly based on your `production.rb` snippet:

```ruby
server '54.188.245.219', user: 'deploy', roles: %w{app db web}, port: 2222
```

### Step 4: Capistrano SSH Options

Sometimes, it's helpful to specify additional SSH options in your Capistrano configuration:

```ruby
# In config/deploy.rb or config/deploy/production.rb
set :ssh_options, {
  keys: %w(~/.ssh/id_rsa),
  forward_agent: true,
  auth_methods: %w(publickey)
}
```

This configuration explicitly states which key to use, that the SSH agent should forward keys, and that the authentication method should be public key only.

### Step 5: Check Server SSH Configuration

Ensure that the server's SSH configuration (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) allows SSH key authentication:

```bash
# These lines should be in /etc/ssh/sshd_config on the server
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication no  # Disable password authentication for security
```

After making any changes, remember to restart the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### Step 6: Debugging SSH

If you continue to experience issues, increase the verbosity of SSH during Capistrano executions to gain more insights:

```bash
# Add to config/deploy.rb
set :ssh_options, {
  verbose: :debug
}
```

### Final Step: Retry Deployment

After ensuring the SSH setup is correct and testing it manually, run the Capistrano deployment again:

```bash
cap production deploy
```

This should resolve the authentication issues, assuming all SSH configurations are correctly set up both locally and on your server.

Based on the contents of your `~/.ssh` directory listing, it looks like you are using an `ed25519` key pair (`id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub`) for SSH. Here's what you need to ensure to effectively use this key pair for your Capistrano deployments:

### Step 1: Ensure Key Is Added to SSH Agent

First, make sure your `ed25519` private key is added to the SSH agent. This is important if you want SSH (and thus Capistrano) to automatically use this key for authentication:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

This command adds your private key to the SSH agent. If you encounter any errors or if the key is already added, it will inform you accordingly.

### Step 2: Configure Capistrano to Use the Correct Key

Given that your setup uses `id_ed25519`, you need to ensure that Capistrano is aware of this key. Update your Capistrano configuration to explicitly specify this key:

```ruby
# config/deploy.rb or the specific environment file like config/deploy/production.rb
set :ssh_options, {
  keys: %w(~/.ssh/id_ed25519),
  forward_agent: true,
  auth_methods: %w(publickey)
}
```

### Step 3: Verify Public Key in Authorized Keys on the Server

Ensure that the public key (`id_ed25519.pub`) is correctly added to the `authorized_keys` file on the server for the `deploy` user:

1. Log into the server as `deploy` if possible, or use `sudo` to access the `deploy` user's home directory.
2. Check the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file to ensure it contains the correct public key. You can compare it by displaying the contents of your local `id_ed25519.pub` file:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

   Ensure this exact key string is in the server's `deploy` user `authorized_keys` file.

### Step 4: Test SSH Connection

Before running Capistrano again, manually test the SSH connection:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -p 2222 deploy@54.188.245.219
```

This command specifies the private key explicitly and attempts to connect to the server. If this succeeds without password prompts, your key setup is correct.

### Step 5: Debugging SSH

If the connection still fails, use verbose output to troubleshoot SSH issues:

```bash
ssh -v -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -p 2222 deploy@54.188.245.219
```

### Step 6: Execute Capistrano Deployment

Once you confirm that the SSH connection works manually, retry the Capistrano deployment:

```bash
cap production deploy
```

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you ensure that the SSH key authentication setup is correct both locally and on your server, paving the way for a successful Capistrano deployment. The use of SSH key authentication, especially with a robust key type like `ed25519`, is a best practice for secure server access and automated deployments.

The "Permission denied (publickey)" error message you received when trying to SSH into your server indicates an issue with the SSH key authentication process. This could be due to several reasons, such as the public key not being correctly added to the `authorized_keys` file on the server, or the SSH server configuration not allowing key-based authentication. Letâ€™s troubleshoot this:

### Step 1: Verify Public Key on the Server
Ensure the public key (`id_ed25519.pub`) is correctly added to the `authorized_keys` file of the `deploy` user on the server. Here are steps to verify and potentially correct this:

1. **Access the Server**:
   If you have administrative access via another method (another user account, or via a control panel if this is a managed server), log in and switch to the `deploy` userâ€™s home directory:
   ```bash
   sudo -i -u deploy
   cd ~
   ```
2. **Check the Authorized Keys File**:
   Open the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file and check if your public key (`id_ed25519.pub`) from your local machine is listed there:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```
   Ensure that the key matches exactly the output of the following command run on your local machine:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

### Step 2: Correctly Add Public Key
If the key is missing or incorrect:
1. **Add the Key Manually**:
   From your local machine, display your public key:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
   Copy the output.
   
2. **Insert the Key into `authorized_keys` on the Server**:
   On the server, edit the `authorized_keys` file:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```
   Paste the public key into this file on a new line.

### Step 3: Ensure Correct Permissions on the Server
SSH is very particular about file permissions for the `.ssh` directory and the `authorized_keys` file:
1. **Set Correct Permissions**:
   ```bash
   chmod 700 ~/.ssh
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

### Step 4: Ensure SSH Configuration Allows Key Authentication
1. **Check SSH Configuration**:
   Check the SSH configuration file (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) for the following lines:
   ```bash
   PubkeyAuthentication yes
   PasswordAuthentication no
   ```
   Make sure that public key authentication is enabled.

2. **Restart SSH Service**:
   If you make any changes to the SSH configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart sshd
   ```

### Step 5: Test SSH Connection Again
Attempt to SSH into the server again with the verbose option to see detailed error messages:
```bash
ssh -v -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -p 2222 deploy@54.188.245.219
```

This command will provide more insight into what is happening during the SSH authentication process. Look for messages related to the public key being offered and either accepted or rejected. This will help identify if your key is being read correctly and offered to the server.

If you continue to experience problems, the verbose output should give you a clearer indication of the issue.

It appears that the permissions and location of your `authorized_keys` file are correct based on the output you've provided. However, since you are experiencing SSH connection issues with the `deploy` user, we should ensure a few more aspects are correct:

### 1. **Verify the Correct User and Home Directory**
Your output indicates that you're checking the `authorized_keys` file for the `ubuntu` user, not the `deploy` user. This could be the reason why authentication is failing if you're trying to connect as `deploy`.

- **Confirm `deploy` User's SSH Directory**:
  If you have access to the `deploy` user, you should check that user's `.ssh/authorized_keys` file, not the `ubuntu` user's. You might need to switch to the `deploy` user and check the `authorized_keys` file there:

  ```bash
  sudo -i -u deploy
  ls -la ~/.ssh
  cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
  ```

### 2. **Ensure the Public Key Matches**
Verify that the public key inside the `deploy` user's `authorized_keys` file matches the public key you are using on your local machine. You can print your local public key and compare it with what's on the server:

- **Local Machine:**
  ```bash
  cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
  ```

- **On the Server (as `deploy`):**
  ```bash
  cat /home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys
  ```

### 3. **Permissions and Ownership**
Make sure that the `.ssh` directory and the `authorized_keys` file for the `deploy` user are properly set up:

- **Permissions** should be strict to ensure SSH does not prevent key use due to security concerns:
  ```bash
  chmod 700 /home/deploy/.ssh
  chmod 600 /home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys
  ```

- **Ownership** should belong to the `deploy` user:
  ```bash
  chown -R deploy:deploy /home/deploy/.ssh
  ```

### 4. **SSH Configuration**
Check if the SSH configuration on the server (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) permits SSH key authentication, and make sure there's no overriding setting for the `deploy` user that might restrict key authentication.

### 5. **Test SSH Connection with Verbose Output**
Re-test your SSH connection with the verbose flag to get more detailed error output, which can help diagnose the issue:

```bash
ssh -v -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -p 2222 deploy@54.188.245.219
```

### 6. **Server Restart**
Ensure that any changes to the SSH configuration or `authorized_keys` file are acknowledged by restarting the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the connection issue. Remember to ensure that you are operating in the correct user context (`deploy` vs. `ubuntu`) and that all settings are aligned for the `deploy` user.

It seems that the `.ssh` directory does not exist for the `deploy` user, which is likely the root cause of your SSH connection issues. The `deploy` user either does not have an SSH configuration set up, or the `.ssh` directory was never created. Here's how to properly set up the `.ssh` directory and the `authorized_keys` file for the `deploy` user.

### Step 1: Create the `.ssh` Directory

First, you need to log into the server as a user with sudo privileges (like `ubuntu`) and then switch to the `deploy` user to set up the SSH directory correctly.

1. **Switch to the `deploy` user**:
   ```bash
   sudo -i -u deploy
   ```
   
2. **Create the `.ssh` directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/.ssh
   chmod 700 ~/.ssh
   ```

### Step 2: Create and Set Up the `authorized_keys` File

1. **Create the `authorized_keys` file**:
   ```bash
   touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

2. **Add your public SSH key**:
   - On your local machine, display your public SSH key:
     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
     ```
   - Copy this key. Then on the server, edit the `authorized_keys` file under the `deploy` user's `.ssh` directory and paste the key there:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
     ```
   - Save and exit the editor.

### Step 3: Verify Ownership

Ensure that both the `.ssh` directory and the `authorized_keys` file are owned by the `deploy` user:

```bash
chown -R deploy:deploy /home/deploy/.ssh
```

### Step 4: Re-check Permissions

Double-check that the permissions are correctly set for security:

```bash
chmod 700 /home/deploy/.ssh
chmod 600 /home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### Step 5: Test SSH Connection

After setting up the SSH configuration properly, exit back to your local terminal and try to SSH into the server as the `deploy` user:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -p 2222 deploy@54.188.245.219
```

### Step 6: Restart SSH Service

Sometimes changes might require the SSH service on the server to be restarted. You can do this by:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

By following these steps, you should be able to set up SSH access for the `deploy` user properly and resolve the connection issues you're experiencing. This setup ensures that the `deploy` user can be used for operations like deployments via Capistrano or other SSH-based automation tools.

The logs you provided indicate that the deployment process was progressing well until it encountered permission issues when trying to create directories under `/var/www/railsdox`. This problem typically arises due to insufficient permissions on the target directory where the application is supposed to be deployed.

Hereâ€™s how to resolve the permission issues:

### Step 1: Verify Directory Ownership and Permissions

You need to ensure that the `deploy` user has the necessary permissions to create and write to the directories in `/var/www/railsdox`. Here are the steps to address this:

1. **Log in as a user with sudo privileges** on the server.
2. **Check the existing permissions** on the `/var/www` directory:
   ```bash
   ls -ld /var/www
   ```
3. **Create the base directory** if it doesn't exist and set the correct permissions:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /var/www/railsdox
   sudo chown deploy:deploy /var/www/railsdox
   sudo chmod 755 /var/www/railsdox
   ```

### Step 2: Set Correct Ownership

Ensure that the `deploy` user owns the `/var/www/railsdox` directory to allow Capistrano to create the needed subdirectories and files:

```bash
sudo chown -R deploy:deploy /var/www/railsdox
```

This command recursively changes the owner of the directory to `deploy`, ensuring that the `deploy` user can create and modify files and directories within.

### Step 3: Retry the Deployment

After adjusting the permissions, try running the Capistrano deployment again:

```bash
cap production deploy
```

### Step 4: Ensure Security

Setting permissions to `755` for directories allows the owner to read, write, and execute, while others can only read and execute. This setting is typically safe for web directories, but always ensure you conform to your security policies.

### Step 5: Debugging Further Issues

If you encounter further permission-related issues, you may need to adjust the permissions not just on the base directory but also on any specific subdirectories or files that require different access settings. Always check the log files for specific errors and address them accordingly.

### Step 6: Automation Consideration

In future deployments, consider scripting these permission and ownership settings either as part of your Capistrano deployment tasks or through initial server setup scripts to avoid manual intervention each time.

By ensuring that the `deploy` user has the correct permissions and ownership over the deployment directory, you should be able to resolve the "Permission denied" issue and successfully deploy your Rails application.

The error message `ERROR linked file /var/www/railsdox/shared/config/database.yml does not exist on 54.188.245.219` indicates that Capistrano is trying to create a symbolic link for the `database.yml` configuration file from the shared folder to the current release directory, but it cannot find the file in the shared directory. This is a common step in Capistrano deployments to maintain configuration files that shouldn't be stored in the version control system and need to persist across deployments.

Hereâ€™s how you can resolve this issue by ensuring that the required configuration files are in place:

### Step 1: Create the Shared Config Directory

Ensure that the directory structure exists on the server. Log into your server and create the necessary directories if they don't exist:

```bash
ssh deploy@54.188.245.219 -p 2222
mkdir -p /var/www/railsdox/shared/config
```

### Step 2: Create the `database.yml`

You need to manually create the `database.yml` file in the `/var/www/railsdox/shared/config` directory because this file usually contains sensitive information like database passwords, and therefore should not be checked into version control.

1. **On the server**, navigate to the shared config directory:
   ```bash
   cd /var/www/railsdox/shared/config
   ```

2. **Create the `database.yml` file**:
   ```bash
   nano database.yml
   ```

3. **Add your database configuration** to the file. Here is a basic template for a PostgreSQL database:
   ```yaml
   default: &default
     adapter: postgresql
     encoding: unicode
     pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
     username: your_database_user
     password: <%= ENV['DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
     host: your_database_host

   development:
     <<: *default
     database: your_project_development

   test:
     <<: *default
     database: your_project_test

   production:
     <<: *default
     database: your_project_production
   ```

4. **Save and exit** the editor.

### Step 3: Ensure Correct Permissions

Make sure the `deploy` user owns the newly created file and has the appropriate permissions:

```bash
chown deploy:deploy /var/www/railsdox/shared/config/database.yml
chmod 600 /var/www/railsdox/shared/config/database.yml
```

### Step 4: Retry the Deployment

Now that the `database.yml` file exists and is correctly configured, retry your Capistrano deployment:

```bash
cap production deploy
```

### Additional Steps

- **Link the File in Capistrano**: Ensure your `deploy.rb` file is set up to link the `database.yml`. This is typically done with something like:
  ```ruby
  append :linked_files, 'config/database.yml'
  ```
  This tells Capistrano that `database.yml` should be linked from the shared folder into each release directory.

- **Environment Variables**: Consider using environment variables (like `DATABASE_PASSWORD` shown above) to securely manage credentials. These can be set in the server's environment or through a tool like `dotenv`.

By ensuring that all necessary configuration files are in place and correctly set up, you help secure your application and smooth the deployment process with Capistrano.

Capistrano is designed to automate deployment processes, but it intentionally does not automatically create configuration files like `database.yml` for several important reasons:

1. **Security**: Configuration files often contain sensitive information, such as database credentials, API keys, and other secrets. Automatically generating these files from a public repository could expose sensitive data unless properly managed.

2. **Environment Specificity**: Each deployment environment (development, test, production) can have different requirements and configurations. Capistrano maintains environment-specific settings by linking to existing configuration files in the shared directory rather than creating new, potentially incorrect configurations during each deploy.

3. **Control and Customization**: Developers might need to customize configurations extensively based on the server architecture or specific requirements, which automated tools might not handle correctly without extensive customization.

### How to Automate Configuration File Setup in Capistrano

Although Capistrano does not create these files, you can automate the process as part of your deployment setup using custom tasks within Capistrano. Hereâ€™s how you can add tasks to manage `database.yml` and other configuration files:

1. **Create a Template File**: Store a template of your `database.yml` and other configuration files in your repository in a different location, or within the `config/deploy/templates` directory if you prefer to keep them organized.

2. **Add Capistrano Task to Generate Configuration Files**: You can create a task in Capistrano to copy or generate the configuration files based on these templates.

Hereâ€™s an example of how you might set this up:

```ruby
# In config/deploy.rb or config/deploy/production.rb

# Task to create database.yml in shared path
namespace :deploy do
  desc 'Setup database configuration'
  task :setup_config do
    on roles(:app) do
      unless test "[ -f #{shared_path}/config/database.yml ]"
        upload! 'config/deploy/templates/database.yml', "#{shared_path}/config/database.yml"
      end
    end
  end
  
  before 'deploy:check:linked_files', 'deploy:setup_config'
end
```

In this setup:

- **The Task**: `deploy:setup_config` checks if `database.yml` exists in the shared directory and uploads it from a template if it does not.
- **Hook**: The task is hooked to run before `deploy:check:linked_files` to ensure it exists before Capistrano tries to link it.

### Automation Considerations

- **Secrets Management**: Be cautious about how you manage secrets in templates. Consider using environment variables or encrypted secrets management solutions instead of hardcoding sensitive information.
- **Version Control**: Keep template or example configuration files in version control but ensure actual credentials or sensitive data are never pushed to repositories.

By automating these steps within Capistrano, you maintain the balance between automation efficiency and the security/control necessary for managing sensitive configurations effectively. This approach ensures that necessary files are in place before each deployment without manually placing them on each server.

The error message indicating that the `master.key` file does not exist on the server is typical when deploying a Rails application using Capistrano. The `master.key` file is crucial for decrypting credentials and other encrypted secrets in a Rails application, and it's designed not to be checked into version control for security reasons. Therefore, Capistrano will not automatically create or manage this file unless explicitly configured to do so.

Hereâ€™s how to address the issue by ensuring that the `master.key` file is correctly placed in the shared directory on your server:

### Step 1: Securely Transfer the `master.key`

You'll need to manually upload the `master.key` file from your local machine to the server if it's not already there. This should be done securely to prevent exposure of sensitive data.

1. **Locate your `master.key`** on your local machine:
   Typically, it's found in your Rails application under `config/master.key`.

2. **Upload the `master.key`** to your server:
   You can use `scp` or an SFTP client. The following command uses `scp` to securely copy the file:
   
   ```bash
   scp -P 2222 config/master.key deploy@54.188.245.219:/var/www/railsdox/shared/config/
   ```
   
   Ensure to replace `54.188.245.219` with your server's IP address and adjust the path as necessary.

### Step 2: Ensure Correct Permissions and Ownership

Once uploaded, ensure the file has the correct permissions and is owned by the `deploy` user.

1. **SSH into your server**:
   ```bash
   ssh -p 2222 deploy@54.188.245.219
   ```

2. **Set the appropriate permissions**:
   ```bash
   chmod 600 /var/www/railsdox/shared/config/master.key
   ```

3. **Check ownership**:
   Ensure the file is owned by the `deploy` user:
   ```bash
   chown deploy:deploy /var/www/railsdox/shared/config/master.key
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Capistrano

Ensure Capistrano is configured to link the `master.key` from the shared directory to each release directory. This is done in your `deploy.rb` file:

```ruby
# config/deploy.rb
append :linked_files, 'config/master.key'
```

This line tells Capistrano that the `master.key` file should be symbolically linked from the shared folder into the current release directory during deployment.

### Step 4: Redeploy Your Application

With the `master.key` now properly in place and configured to be linked, re-run your Capistrano deployment:

```bash
cap production deploy
```

### Security Considerations

- **Handling Sensitive Files**: Always ensure that sensitive files like `master.key` are transferred securely (using SSH or SFTP) and are never exposed in logs or to unauthorized access.
- **Backup**: Keep secure backups of your `master.key` file. Losing this key will render encrypted data inaccessible.
- **Access Control**: Limit access to the server and particularly to sensitive files to only those who absolutely need it.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with the missing `master.key` file and ensure your Rails application is securely deployed with all necessary configuration files in place.

The error you are encountering with Puma indicates that the command `bundle exec puma -C /var/www/railsdox/shared/puma.rb --daemon` is using the `--daemon` flag, which is no longer supported in more recent versions of Puma. Starting from Puma version 5.0, the `--daemon` flag was removed as Puma encourages using more modern process managers like systemd to manage background processes rather than handling daemonization within the application.

Hereâ€™s how to address and adjust your deployment configuration:

### Step 1: Update the Puma Configuration

Instead of using the `--daemon` flag, you should update your Puma configuration to be managed by a process manager. If you're already using a tool like systemd, you should configure a systemd service to manage your Puma process.

### Example of Systemd Service File for Puma

Create a systemd service file (for example, `/etc/systemd/system/puma.service`) with content similar to this:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Puma HTTP Server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=deploy
WorkingDirectory=/var/www/railsdox/current
ExecStart=/bin/bash -lc 'bundle exec puma -C /var/www/railsdox/shared/puma.rb'
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

This service will handle starting and stopping Puma and will not require the `--daemon` option since the service itself runs in the background.

### Step 2: Adjust Capistrano Deployment Script

Remove any references to the `--daemon` flag in your deployment scripts or Capistrano tasks.

If you're using Capistrano to start Puma, ensure it doesn't pass the `--daemon` flag. For instance, check your `deploy.rb` or any specific Puma configuration under `lib/capistrano/tasks/` and update the command accordingly.

### Step 3: Control Puma with Systemd

After setting up the systemd service:

1. **Enable the service** to start at boot:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable puma.service
   ```

2. **Start the service** manually for the first time or after configuration changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start puma.service
   ```

3. **Check the status** of your Puma service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status puma.service
   ```

4. **View logs** for potential errors during startup:
   ```bash
   journalctl -u puma.service
   ```

### Step 4: Redeploy Your Application

Once these changes are made, redeploy your application:

```bash
cap production deploy
```

This should now work without trying to use the deprecated `--daemon` flag and will utilize systemd to manage your Puma process in the background effectively.

### Step 5: Verify Deployment

Ensure that your application is up and running after the deployment. Check Puma's status through systemd and access your application through a web browser to confirm that it is serving requests correctly.

Your Puma configuration file (`puma.rb`) looks correctly set up for running Puma in a production environment using UNIX sockets, logging, and handling configuration upon restarts. The missing part, given the context of removing the `--daemon` flag, is integrating this with a system service manager like systemd to ensure Puma runs as a background service.

### Integrating Puma with systemd

Since you're no longer using the `--daemon` flag, you'll need to manage Puma with systemd to ensure it starts at boot and restarts on failure. Here's how to proceed:

1. **Create a Systemd Service File for Puma**

   Create a new systemd service file named `puma.service` in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory on your server.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/puma.service
   ```

   Add the following configuration:

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Puma HTTP Server for Railsdox
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=deploy
   WorkingDirectory=/var/www/railsdox/current
   EnvironmentFile=/var/www/railsdox/current/.env
   ExecStart=/bin/bash -lc 'bundle exec puma -C /var/www/railsdox/shared/puma.rb'
   Restart=always
   PIDFile=/var/www/railsdox/shared/tmp/pids/puma.pid

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   This configuration tells systemd to start Puma using the settings from your `puma.rb` file, and to restart it automatically if it crashes. The `EnvironmentFile` line can be adjusted or removed based on how you manage environment variables.

2. **Enable and Start the Service**

   Enable the Puma service to start on boot and start it immediately:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable puma.service
   sudo systemctl start puma.service
   ```

3. **Check the Status**

   Verify that the service is running correctly:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status puma.service
   ```

   You can also check the Puma logs you've configured for any runtime errors or confirmation that Puma is serving requests:
   
   ```bash
   cat /var/www/railsdox/shared/log/puma_error.log
   cat /var/www/railsdox/shared/log/puma_access.log
   ```

4. **Update Capistrano Deployment**

   Ensure your Capistrano deployment scripts are updated to not try and start Puma with the `--daemon` flag. Instead, they should manage the systemd service:

   ```ruby
   # In deploy.rb or a specific task file for Puma in your Capistrano setup:
   namespace :puma do
     desc 'Restart Puma service'
     task :restart do
       on roles(:app) do
         execute :sudo, 'systemctl restart puma.service'
       end
     end
   end

   after 'deploy:publishing', 'puma:restart'
   ```

This setup will integrate Puma with systemd effectively, making use of the modern best practices for deploying Ruby on Rails applications with Puma, ensuring reliability and ease of management.

The current systemd service file configuration you posted uses a general setup for running a Puma server, but it might not be fully appropriate for your specific application setup based on the Capistrano configurations you've shown. Here's how you can modify it to better align with your deployment setup and ensure it correctly uses your specific settings from the `puma.rb` file.

### Modified Systemd Service File

Based on your earlier Puma and deployment configurations, here's how you can adjust the systemd service file:

1. **Update the User**: Ensure the user is `deploy` if that is the user under which your application should run. If `ubuntu` is the user owning the deployment directory and running the Puma process, then keep it as `ubuntu`.

2. **Update the Working Directory**: This should point to your current application's release directory managed by Capistrano, typically `/var/www/railsdox/current`.

3. **Update the ExecStart**: Use the full path to the `bundle` command and specify the Puma configuration file path.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Puma HTTP Server for Railsdox
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=deploy
WorkingDirectory=/var/www/railsdox/current
ExecStart=/bin/bash -lc 'bundle exec puma -C /var/www/railsdox/shared/puma.rb'
Restart=always
PIDFile=/var/www/railsdox/shared/tmp/pids/puma.pid

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **User**: The service runs under the `deploy` user, which should have the necessary permissions for all files and directories related to the application.
- **WorkingDirectory**: Points to `/var/www/railsdox/current` where Capistrano deploys the latest release.
- **ExecStart**: Calls `bundle exec puma` with the specific Puma configuration file, ensuring that all settings, such as directory paths, log files, and socket files, are taken from the `puma.rb` configuration.
- **Restart**: Configured to always restart on failure.
- **PIDFile**: Points to the PID file location specified in the `puma.rb` to help systemd manage the service correctly.

### Actions to Apply Changes

To apply these changes, follow these steps:

1. **Edit the Service File**:
   Open the service file in an editor:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/puma.service
   ```
   Make the changes as above.

2. **Reload Systemd**:
   After modifying the systemd service file, reload the systemd manager configuration to apply changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

3. **Restart Puma Service**:
   Restart the service to apply the new configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart puma.service
   ```

4. **Enable Puma Service**:
   Ensure the Puma service is enabled to start on boot:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable puma.service
   ```

5. **Check the Status**:
   Check the status of the Puma service to ensure it's active and running without errors:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status puma.service
   ```

This updated configuration will ensure that your Puma server is correctly integrated with systemd, using the specific settings for your Rails application, managed by Capistrano.

It appears you're still encountering issues with the `--daemon` flag when trying to start Puma. As mentioned previously, this flag has been removed in recent versions of Puma (starting from version 5.0), and trying to use it will lead to errors. The correct approach is to manage Puma as a system service, particularly using tools like systemd, which handles daemonization internally and more robustly than application-specific daemon flags.

### Correcting the Puma Start Command

To correct the issue, you should modify your deployment scripts or Capistrano tasks to remove the `--daemon` flag from the Puma start command. Instead, you should ensure that Puma is being managed by systemd, as outlined previously.

1. **Modify the Capistrano Deployment Task**: You need to ensure that any Capistrano tasks that start Puma do not use the `--daemon` flag. Instead, they should rely on systemd to start and manage the Puma process. Here's an example adjustment you might need to make in your `deploy.rb` or wherever you configure Capistrano tasks:

   ```ruby
   # Remove the --daemon flag and rely on systemd to manage Puma
   namespace :puma do
     desc 'Start Puma'
     task :start do
       on roles(:app) do
         execute :sudo, 'systemctl start puma.service'
       end
     end

     desc 'Stop Puma'
     task :stop do
       on roles(:app) do
         execute :sudo, 'systemctl stop puma.service'
       end
     end

     desc 'Restart Puma'
     task :restart do
       on roles(:app) do
         execute :sudo, 'systemctl restart puma.service'
       end
     end
   end

   # Hook these tasks into the deploy process
   after 'deploy:published', 'puma:restart'
   ```

2. **Ensure Systemd Service File is Correct**: Double-check the systemd service file `/etc/systemd/system/puma.service` to make sure it correctly points to your application's current directory and uses the correct Puma configuration file:

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Puma HTTP Server for Railsdox
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=deploy
   WorkingDirectory=/var/www/railsdox/current
   ExecStart=/bin/bash -lc 'bundle exec puma -C /var/www/railsdox/shared/puma.rb'
   Restart=always
   PIDFile=/var/www/railsdox/shared/tmp/pids/puma.pid

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

3. **Reload and Restart Systemd Service**: Whenever you make changes to a systemd service file, you must reload the systemd configuration and restart the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart puma.service
   ```

4. **Test and Debug**: After making these changes, try deploying again with Capistrano. You can check the status of the Puma service with:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status puma.service
   ```

   Additionally, check the logs for errors:

   ```bash
   journalctl -u puma.service
   ```

These steps should align your deployment process with best practices for managing Puma using systemd, thereby eliminating issues related to deprecated flags and ensuring a more robust and maintainable setup.

The persistent issue with the `--daemon` flag in your Capistrano deployment scripts for Puma suggests there may be an oversight where old commands are still being executed despite previous updates or communications to remove or update them. Hereâ€™s what you can do to resolve this:

### Step 1: Verify Deployment Scripts
Ensure that all references to Puma in your Capistrano deployment scripts (`deploy.rb` or any task files related to Puma under `lib/capistrano/tasks/`) do not include the `--daemon` flag. Search through these files to confirm:

```bash
grep -R "--daemon" /path/to/your/capistrano/configs
```

### Step 2: Update Capistrano Puma Tasks
Make sure that your Capistrano tasks are using the recommended approach for handling Puma with systemd. If you havenâ€™t already updated these tasks to remove the `--daemon` flag, here's how you should set it up:

Edit your Puma tasks in Capistrano to ensure they look something like this:

```ruby
namespace :puma do
  desc 'Manage Puma'
  task :start do
    on roles(:app) do
      execute :sudo, 'systemctl start puma.service'
    end
  end

  task :stop do
    on roles(:app) do
      execute :sudo, 'systemctl stop puma.service'
    end
  end

  task :restart do
    on roles(:app) do
      execute :sudo, 'systemctl restart puma.service'
    end
  end
end

# Make sure these hooks are connected
after 'deploy:published', 'puma:restart'
```

### Step 3: Ensure Systemd Service is Correctly Configured
Double-check your `puma.service` file. It should not require the `--daemon` flag since systemd manages the process in the background. The service file at `/etc/systemd/system/puma.service` should look like this:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Puma HTTP Server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=deploy
WorkingDirectory=/var/www/railsdox/current
ExecStart=/bin/bash -lc 'bundle exec puma -C /var/www/railsdox/shared/puma.rb'
Restart=always
PIDFile=/var/www/railsdox/shared/tmp/pids/puma.pid

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Step 4: Reload and Restart Systemd
Whenever changes are made to the systemd service file:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart puma.service
```

### Step 5: Deploy Again
Run your Capistrano deployment again:

```bash
cap production deploy
```

### Step 6: Check for Errors
If there are still issues, check the detailed error logs. Look at both Capistrano's output and the systemd logs:

```bash
journalctl -u puma.service
```

This should give you a clear indication of what might still be going wrong. 

### Final Check
Make sure that there is no cached version or a misunderstanding in the deployment pipeline that could be causing the old command with the `--daemon` flag to be executed. If the problem persists, you might need to verify that the correct version of your deployment scripts is being used and that no old precompiled tasks are being run.

It looks like there was a small mistake in the command I provided for using `grep` to search for the `--daemon` flag. The issue is that `grep` interprets `--daemon` as an option rather than a string to search for due to the leading double dashes. To correctly search for `--daemon` as a string, you need to either escape the dashes or use a different method to ensure `grep` treats it as a string.

Here are the correct ways to perform this search:

### Using Backslash to Escape Dashes
```bash
grep -R "\--daemon" /path/to/your/capistrano/configs
```

### Using the `-e` Option
The `-e` option is used with `grep` to specify the pattern explicitly, which helps when the pattern begins with a dash (`-`).
```bash
grep -R -e "--daemon" /path/to/your/capistrano/configs
```

### Specifying a Path
Make sure to replace `/path/to/your/capistrano/configs` with the actual path to your Capistrano configuration files. If you're not sure where this is, you might typically find these configurations in your Rails project under a directory like `config/deploy`. Here's how you might do it assuming your configs are in the standard location:

```bash
grep -R -e "--daemon" ~/work/rails-docs/config/deploy
```

This command will search through all files in the specified directory for the string `--daemon`. If you find any occurrences, you should remove them or adjust the commands to align with the systemd management approach, as previously discussed.

Make sure you're running this command in the directory that actually contains your Capistrano configurations. Adjust the path according to where your Capistrano files are stored.

The error message indicates that Capistrano cannot find the `Capistrano::Puma` module, which suggests that the `capistrano-puma` gem might not be installed, or it's not properly required in your project's configuration files.

### Step 1: Ensure the `capistrano-puma` Gem Is Installed

First, make sure you have the `capistrano-puma` gem included in your project's `Gemfile`. Open your `Gemfile` and check for the following line:

```ruby
gem 'capistrano-puma', require: false
```

If it's not there, add it, and then run:

```bash
bundle install
```

### Step 2: Require the Plugin in Your Capfile

After installing the gem, you need to ensure it's required in your `Capfile`, which is usually located in the root of your Rails application. Open the `Capfile` and check if there's a line like:

```ruby
require 'capistrano/puma'
```

This line should be before any `install_plugin` calls related to Puma. If you're using specific integration features like Puma workers, nginx, or systemd, you might also need to include:

```ruby
install_plugin Capistrano::Puma
install_plugin Capistrano::Puma::Workers
install_plugin Capistrano::Puma::Nginx
```

Ensure that the `install_plugin` calls are appropriate for the features you are using.

### Step 3: Verify Configuration

After adding the necessary lines to your `Gemfile` and `Capfile`, run `bundle install` to make sure all gems are correctly installed.

### Step 4: Deploy Again

Try to deploy your application again using:

```bash
cap production deploy
```

### Step 5: Check for Errors

If you encounter further errors, consider running the task with `--trace` to get a detailed output, which can help in diagnosing the problem:

```bash
cap production deploy --trace
```

This command will provide a detailed stack trace that can help identify where exactly in your configuration or setup the issue is occurring.

### Final Check

Make sure all paths and configurations in Capistrano scripts are correctly set up and point to the right directories and settings. If you made any changes to the system environment or paths, it might be good to restart your terminal or SSH session to ensure all changes are picked up.

If you've gone through these steps and are still encountering issues, it might be useful to revisit the documentation for the `capistrano-puma` gem or seek specific guidance on the error message you're encountering.

Yes, your Capfile setup appears mostly correct, but there's a redundancy that you might want to address. You've installed the `Capistrano::Puma` plugin twice, once with default settings and once with `load_hooks: false`. Typically, you would choose one or the other depending on your needs.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown and a recommended adjustment:

### Understanding the Redundancy

- `install_plugin Capistrano::Puma`: This line installs the Puma plugin with all its default hooks. Hooks are tasks that run automatically at certain points in the Capistrano execution process.
- `install_plugin Capistrano::Puma, load_hooks: false`: This line installs the Puma plugin without loading its default hooks. This might be useful if you want to customize or replace the standard behavior with something specific to your deployment process.

Unless you have a specific reason to configure the hooks differently within the same deployment process, you should choose one method to avoid conflicts or unintended behavior.

### Recommended Capfile

Here's how you could streamline your Capfile based on typical needs:

```ruby
# Load DSL and set up stages
require "capistrano/setup"

# Include default deployment tasks
require "capistrano/deploy"

# Include specific tasks from other Capistrano plugins
require 'capistrano/bundler'  # Handle bundle install
require 'capistrano/rails/assets'  # Handle asset precompilation
require 'capistrano/rails/migrations'  # Handle database migrations
require 'capistrano/puma'  # Puma support
install_plugin Capistrano::Puma  # Load default Puma tasks
install_plugin Capistrano::Puma::Systemd  # Additional support for managing Puma via Systemd

# Load the SCM plugin appropriate to your project
require "capistrano/scm/git"
install_plugin Capistrano::SCM::Git  # Use Git as the source control

# Uncomment the following if you need additional control over SCM or if you use Mercurial or SVN
# require "capistrano/scm/hg"
# install_plugin Capistrano::SCM::Hg
# or
# require "capistrano/scm/svn"
# install_plugin Capistrano::SCM::Svn
```

### Notes:

- **Systemd Integration**: The `Capistrano::Puma::Systemd` plugin is useful if you manage Puma with systemd. It helps integrate Puma management directly with systemd commands rather than handling start/stop through cap tasks, which can be more robust and align with modern Linux administration practices.
- **Hooks Configuration**: If you want more control over when specific Puma-related tasks are triggered, or if you need to disable them for some reason, you can reconsider the use of `load_hooks: false`.

This setup assumes you are deploying a Rails application with Puma as the web server and using Git for version control, which is a common setup. Make sure to run `bundle install` if you make changes to your `Gemfile` to include any new gems, and always check your deployment with `cap production deploy --trace` for detailed debugging information if things don't go as planned.

To prevent Capistrano from starting the Puma server during the deployment process, you can modify your Capistrano tasks to skip the Puma start task. This is often done by overriding the task in your deployment script or by simply not calling the Puma start tasks in your deployment configuration.

### Step 1: Prevent Puma from Starting in Capistrano

In your `deploy.rb` or specific environment file (e.g., `config/deploy/production.rb`), you can override the Puma start task to do nothing:

```ruby
namespace :puma do
  task :start do
    on roles(:app) do
      info "Skipping Puma start"
    end
  end
end
```

This will effectively prevent Capistrano from starting Puma when the `puma:start` task is invoked.

### Step 2: Manually Start Puma

After deployment, if you need to manually start Puma on your server, you can do so by logging into your server and running the Puma command directly from the current release directory. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **SSH into your server:**
   ```bash
   ssh user@your.server.ip
   ```

2. **Navigate to your application's current directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /var/www/your_application_name/current
   ```

3. **Start Puma manually:**
   You can start Puma using a command similar to what Capistrano might use. This assumes you have a Puma configuration file (`puma.rb`) set up in your application:

   ```bash
   bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb
   ```

   Here, `-C config/puma.rb` tells Puma to use the configuration file located at `config/puma.rb` in your application directory.

### Additional Configuration for Systemd

If you manage Puma with systemd and want to control it manually, ensure you have a systemd service set up for Puma. Hereâ€™s a basic command to start Puma using systemd:

```bash
sudo systemctl start puma
```

This command assumes that you have a systemd service named `puma.service`. If your service has a different name or location, you'll need to adjust the command accordingly.

### Verifying Puma is Running

After starting Puma, either manually or via systemd, you can check its status to ensure it's running correctly:

- **Direct Puma process check:**
  ```bash
  ps aux | grep puma
  ```

- **Systemd status check:**
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status puma
  ```

These steps allow you to fully control when and how Puma starts, independent of Capistrano's deployment process. This can be particularly useful in environments where you need more granular control over service management post-deployment.

The error message you're seeing indicates a mismatch between your Gemfile and Gemfile.lock. This can occur when changes are made to the Gemfileâ€”such as adding or removing gemsâ€”but the Gemfile.lock isn't updated accordingly. The error message specifically points out that `capistrano-rbenv` and `capistrano3-puma` have been deleted from the Gemfile but are still expected according to the Gemfile.lock. Hereâ€™s how to resolve this:

### Step 1: Run `bundle install`

To synchronize your Gemfile and Gemfile.lock, run `bundle install` on your development machine where you're making changes:

```bash
bundle install
```

This command updates the Gemfile.lock to reflect the current state of the Gemfile. Make sure you do this in the directory where your Rails application is located.

### Step 2: Commit the Updated Gemfile and Gemfile.lock

After running `bundle install`, ensure that both the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock are updated accordingly:

```bash
git add Gemfile Gemfile.lock
git commit -m "Update Gemfile and Gemfile.lock"
git push
```

This step is crucial because it ensures that the changes you make locally are also reflected in the repository and hence, on any other environments like staging or production.

### Step 3: Deploy Again

Once the changes are committed and pushed to your repository, try deploying again using Capistrano:

```bash
cap production deploy
```

This will use the updated Gemfile and Gemfile.lock during the deployment process.

### Step 4: Check for Further Issues

If the deployment fails again with a similar error, double-check that the updates were correctly pulled during the deployment. Sometimes, especially if caching is involved or if there's a misconfiguration, old files might be used. Verify that your deployment scripts are pulling the latest changes from your repository.

### Step 5: Addressing Removed Gems

If you intentionally removed `capistrano-rbenv` and `capistrano3-puma` from the Gemfile, ensure that you also remove any references to these gems in your Capfile and deployment scripts. For example, if you had:

```ruby
require 'capistrano/rbenv'
require 'capistrano/puma'
```

Make sure to remove or comment out these lines if these gems are no longer part of your project.

### Step 6: Handling Persistent Gemfile.lock Issues

If you keep encountering issues with Gemfile.lock not being updated or recognized properly, consider running:

```bash
bundle config set --local frozen false
```

This command changes the local configuration to not freeze the Gemfile.lock state, which can sometimes help in development but should be used cautiously.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the mismatch error and successfully deploy your application. If the problem persists, check for any additional discrepancies between your local development environment and the deployment environment, or any specific Capistrano configurations that might influence gem handling.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart puma.service
```

To investigate the issue with your Puma service, you can use the commands mentioned in the error message to check for detailed logs that will help diagnose the problem:

1. **Check the status of the Puma service:**
   ```bash
   systemctl status puma.service
   ```

2. **View detailed logs for the Puma service:**
   ```bash
   journalctl -xeu puma.service
   ```

These commands will provide insights into why the service might have failed to start, such as configuration errors, permissions issues, or other system-level problems.

The status message indicates that your Puma service has failed due to a resource limitation or another system-level issue. This type of problem might relate to several potential causes, such as:

- **Insufficient System Resources**: Lack of memory, CPU, or other system resources needed to start and run the Puma server.
- **Dependency Issues**: Missing software dependencies required by Puma or your Rails application.
- **Permission Problems**: Incorrect file permissions in the directories Puma needs to access.
- **Configuration Errors**: Issues in your Puma configuration file or related environment settings that prevent Puma from starting correctly.

To further investigate and identify the specific cause, you should look at the logs provided by `journalctl`. This command will give more detailed error messages that can pinpoint what needs to be fixed:

```bash
journalctl -xeu puma.service
```

Review the output from this command to find error messages or warnings that occur around the time the service failed to start. These logs are essential for diagnosing the problem accurately.

If the `journalctl -xeu puma.service` command is returning "-- No entries --", it suggests that no logs are being recorded for the Puma service at the moment, which could mean one of several things:

1. **Incorrect Log Configuration**: The service might not be configured correctly to log its output or errors. This can happen if the logging paths or mechanisms in the Puma configuration file or systemd service file are misconfigured.

2. **Systemd Service Misconfiguration**: The service file itself may be incorrectly set up, not pointing to the correct executable or not using the correct working directory.

3. **File Permissions**: The service might not have the appropriate permissions to write to its designated log files or execute its binaries.

### Steps to Diagnose Further:

#### Step 1: Double-check the Puma Service File
Make sure that the service file is correctly pointing to the right executable paths and that it uses the correct user and group. Here's a basic example for reference:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Puma HTTP Server for Railsdox
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=deploy
WorkingDirectory=/var/www/railsdox/current
ExecStart=/bin/bash -lc 'bundle exec puma -C /var/www/railsdox/shared/puma.rb'
Restart=always
PIDFile=/var/www/railsdox/shared/tmp/pids/puma.pid

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Ensure all paths are correct and accessible by the user under which the service runs (`deploy` in this case).

#### Step 2: Verify Puma Configuration
Check your `puma.rb` for any incorrect settings that could prevent logging or starting up, such as incorrect paths to log files, binding ports that are already in use, or configuration syntax errors.

#### Step 3: Check System Logs
Sometimes, system logs might provide more information if `journalctl` for the specific service does not. Try:

```bash
sudo journalctl -xe
```

And review the general system logs around the time you attempted to start the service.

#### Step 4: Try Starting Puma Manually
To isolate whether the issue is with systemd or with Puma itself, try running the Puma start command manually from the terminal:

```bash
cd /var/www/railsdox/current
/bin/bash -lc 'bundle exec puma -C /var/www/railsdox/shared/puma.rb'
```

This can sometimes provide direct output that doesn't get logged by systemd.

#### Step 5: Validate System Resources
Check if your system is running out of resources (like memory or CPU), which could also cause the service to fail:

```bash
free -h
top
```

This checks for available memory and current CPU usage, respectively.

#### Step 6: Ensure Proper Permissions
Ensure that all directories and files that Puma needs access to have the correct permissions:

```bash
sudo chown -R deploy:deploy /var/www/railsdox
sudo chmod -R u+rwX,g+rX,o+rX /var/www/railsdox
```

These commands set the ownership to `deploy` and ensure readable/writable permissions as needed.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify why the Puma service isn't starting and why logs aren't being produced.

The message "The unit puma.service has entered the 'failed' state with result 'resources'" indicates that the failure is likely related to resource constraints or misconfigurations that prevent the service from obtaining the necessary system resources to start.

Here are steps you can take to diagnose and potentially resolve this issue:

### Step 1: Review System Resources
Check if your server is running low on essential resources like memory or CPU. Use the following commands to get a snapshot of the current resource usage:

```bash
free -m   # Check memory usage
df -h     # Check disk space usage
top       # Monitor CPU and memory in real-time
```

If the server is low on memory or disk space, consider increasing these resources or optimizing other services to free up resources.

### Step 2: Validate the Puma Configuration
Errors in the `puma.rb` configuration file, such as setting too many worker processes or threads more than what your server can handle, could cause resource issues. Open the `puma.rb` file located at `/var/www/railsdox/shared/puma.rb` and review settings such as `workers` and `threads`:

```ruby
workers 2   # Adjust this number based on your server's CPU cores
threads 1, 5  # Adjust min and max threads
```

Try reducing the number of workers or threads to see if that resolves the issue.

### Step 3: Check Puma Logs
Even if `journalctl -xeu puma.service` did not return detailed logs, try to look at the application-specific logs that Puma might be outputting, often defined in your `puma.rb` file:

```bash
cat /var/www/railsdox/shared/log/puma_error.log
cat /var/www/railsdox/shared/log/puma_access.log
```

These logs might contain more specific error messages regarding what resource is lacking or configuration issues.

### Step 4: Examine Systemd Unit File
Check the `puma.service` file for any potential configuration issues that could be causing resource errors. Pay special attention to limits set within the service file:

```bash
cat /etc/systemd/system/puma.service
```

Look for directives like `LimitCPU`, `LimitFSIZE`, or `LimitNOFILE` and adjust them if they are too restrictive:

```ini
[Service]
...
LimitNOFILE=4096
```

### Step 5: Manually Start Puma
Attempt to start Puma manually to see if the service itself throws any errors when not started by systemd:

```bash
cd /var/www/railsdox/current
bundle exec puma -C /var/www/railsdox/shared/puma.rb
```

### Step 6: Restart and Reenable Service
After making changes, try to restart the service and see if it stays active:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload  # Reload systemd manager configuration
sudo systemctl restart puma.service  # Restart Puma service
sudo systemctl status puma.service  # Check the status again
```

By following these steps, you should be able to further diagnose why the Puma service is failing and take appropriate action based on the specific cause.

Your `free -m` command output shows that you have a total of 3904 MB of RAM, with 2549 MB free and 1111 MB used as buffer/cache. This indicates that low memory does not seem to be the cause of the Puma service failure, as there is ample free memory available.

Given this, the issue might not be related to memory constraints. Here are a few more steps you can take to troubleshoot:

### Step 1: Check for Open File Limits
Since your server isn't constrained by memory, check if you're hitting the open file descriptor limits, which is a common issue for web servers like Puma that handle many connections.

1. **Check the current limit for open files for the `deploy` user:**
   ```bash
   su - deploy -c 'ulimit -n'
   ```

2. **If the number is low (like 1024), you might need to increase it.** Modify the limits for the `deploy` user by editing the `/etc/security/limits.conf` file and adding:
   ```bash
   deploy soft nofile 4096
   deploy hard nofile 4096
   ```

3. **After modifying the limits, you may need to restart your session or the system to apply the changes.**

### Step 2: Validate Disk Space
Although not typically a resource issue labeled by systemd, ensuring ample disk space is critical.

1. **Check disk space usage:**
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```
   Ensure there is enough space on the disk where your application and logs are stored.

### Step 3: Recheck Systemd Service Settings
Ensure that the systemd service file for Puma is configured correctly, particularly around user permissions and working directories.

1. **Check the systemd service file:**
   ```bash
   cat /etc/systemd/system/puma.service
   ```

2. **Look for any incorrect paths or user permissions issues that might prevent Puma from starting correctly.**

### Step 4: Attempt Manual Start
Since system resources like memory and disk space don't appear to be the issue, try manually starting the Puma server again to see if any errors are thrown directly to the console:

1. **Navigate to the Rails application directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /var/www/railsdox/current
   ```

2. **Start Puma manually with debugging:**
   ```bash
   bundle exec puma -C /var/www/railsdox/shared/puma.rb --debug
   ```

   This might provide more verbose output related to the issue.

### Step 5: Review Puma Configuration File
1. **Inspect the `puma.rb` configuration:**
   ```bash
   cat /var/www/railsdox/shared/puma.rb
   ```
   Verify settings like `bind`, `port`, and `workers` to ensure they are suitable for your server's specifications.

By following these steps, you should gain further insights into why the Puma service might be failing to start and not related to memory or CPU constraints. If the manual start provides new information, that could be key to diagnosing the issue.

The `df -h` output indicates that you have adequate disk space on your primary partitions:

- Your root partition (`/dev/root`) has 3.4 GB available, which is generally sufficient for typical operations.
- Other mounted filesystems like `/dev/shm`, `/run`, `/run/lock`, `/boot/efi`, and `/run/user/1000` show very low usage percentages, indicating no immediate disk space issues.

Given that memory and disk space do not appear to be the problem, and assuming file descriptor limits and permissions are not issues either (as per the previous steps), here are additional steps you can take to isolate the problem:

### Step 1: Validate Environment and Dependencies
Check if all necessary environment variables and dependencies for your Rails application and Puma are properly set up and available:

1. **Check for necessary environment variables within the session that starts Puma:**
   ```bash
   printenv | grep RAILS
   ```

2. **Ensure all gems are correctly installed and available:**
   ```bash
   bundle check
   ```

### Step 2: Examine Pumaâ€™s Systemd Service File
Review the systemd service configuration again, paying close attention to any directives that could cause a failure, especially under resource constraints not related to disk or memory.

1. **Look for specific resource-related directives (if any), such as `LimitNPROC` or `MemoryLimit`:**
   ```bash
   grep -i "limit" /etc/systemd/system/puma.service
   ```

2. **Ensure the `User` and `WorkingDirectory` are correctly set and accessible by the user Puma runs under.**

### Step 3: Manually Start Puma with Debug Information
To gain more insights into what might be going wrong during the startup, manually run Puma with debug-level logging:

1. **Navigate to the current directory of your Rails application and start Puma with debug logging:**
   ```bash
   cd /var/www/railsdox/current
   bundle exec puma -C /var/www/railsdox/shared/puma.rb --debug
   ```

### Step 4: Check for System-wide Issues
Itâ€™s also possible that broader system issues might be impacting Pumaâ€™s ability to start, such as kernel parameters or system security policies:

1. **Check for relevant syslog entries that might indicate system-wide issues affecting services:**
   ```bash
   sudo grep puma /var/log/syslog
   ```

2. **Review security policies like SELinux or AppArmor, which might be restricting Puma's operations:**
   ```bash
   getenforce  # For SELinux
   sudo apparmor_status  # For AppArmor
   ```

### Step 5: Test Network and Binding Issues
Make sure that Puma is not failing due to network binding issues, particularly if it's set to bind to a specific IP or port that is already in use or restricted.

1. **Check if the port Puma is configured to use is available:**
   ```bash
   sudo netstat -tulpn | grep <port>
   ```

   Replace `<port>` with the actual port number Puma is configured to listen on.

By following these steps, you should be able to further isolate why the Puma service is failing to start despite sufficient disk and memory resources. Each step is designed to systematically rule out common issues that might not initially be obvious.
