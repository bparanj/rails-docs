The error message you're seeing, `ActionView::Template::Error (The asset "application.css" is not present in the asset pipeline.)`, indicates that Rails is unable to locate the `application.css` file when trying to compile and serve your assets. This is common in a Rails application that employs the asset pipeline for managing its assets.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

### 1. **Check Your Stylesheet File**

Ensure that you have an `application.css` file or its equivalent (like `application.scss` if using SASS) in your `app/assets/stylesheets` directory. The file should be named exactly as referenced in your view or layout file.

If you're using SASS or another preprocessor, make sure that Rails is set up to compile these files properly.

### 2. **Inspect the Stylesheet Link Tag**

In your `application.html.erb` layout file, you have the following line:

```erb
<%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", "data-turbo-track": "reload" %>
```

Verify that the name `"application"` correctly corresponds to a stylesheet named `application.css` in your `app/assets/stylesheets` directory. If the file is named differently, you should update the tag to match the filename without the extension.

### 3. **Precompile Assets**

Sometimes, especially in production environments, you need to precompile your assets. You can do this locally or as part of your deployment process. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
rails assets:precompile
```

This command compiles all your assets, including stylesheets, JavaScript files, images, and other resources, and places them in the `public/assets` directory.

### 4. **Check the Asset Pipeline Configuration**

Look at your Rails configuration settings related to assets in `config/environments/production.rb` (if this error occurs in production) or `config/environments/development.rb` (if in development). Ensure that the asset pipeline is enabled:

```ruby
# Example for production environment
config.assets.compile = false  # Consider setting this to true if assets are not precompiling
config.assets.digest = true
```

If `config.assets.compile` is `false`, Rails expects that assets will be precompiled and available in the `public/assets` directory. If they aren't, you might encounter the error you're seeing.

### 5. **Clear the Cache**

Sometimes stale assets can cause issues. Clear your Rails cache and the asset cache with:

```bash
rails tmp:cache:clear
rails assets:clobber
```

### 6. **Restart the Server**

After making changes related to assets, especially changes in the asset pipeline configuration or after precompiling assets, it's a good idea to restart your Rails server:

```bash
rails server
```

### 7. **Deployment Consideration**

If this issue appears during deployment (e.g., Heroku, AWS), ensure that your deployment scripts include asset precompilation. For Heroku, this is typically handled automatically unless disabled.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error related to missing assets in the asset pipeline and ensure that your application correctly serves its static files.
