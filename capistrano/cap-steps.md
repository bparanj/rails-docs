Here are the steps to deploy a Rails 7 app using Capistrano 3 on an Ubuntu 22.04 server:

1. Set up the server:
   - Install necessary dependencies: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git nodejs postgresql libpq-dev nginx`
   - Install Ruby (e.g., using rbenv or rvm)
   - Install Bundler: `gem install bundler`
   - Configure PostgreSQL and create a database for your app

2. Set up the Rails app:
   - Add the Capistrano gem to your Gemfile: `gem 'capistrano', '~> 3.11'`
   - Run `bundle install`
   - Run `cap install` to generate Capistrano configuration files

3. Configure Capistrano:
   - Open `Capfile` and uncomment the necessary Capistrano modules (e.g., `capistrano/rails`, `capistrano/bundler`, `capistrano/rbenv` or `capistrano/rvm`)
   - Update `config/deploy.rb` with your app's details:
     ```ruby
     set :application, 'your_app_name'
     set :repo_url, 'git@github.com:username/repo.git'
     set :deploy_to, '/path/to/deploy/directory'
     set :branch, 'main'
     ```
   - Update `config/deploy/production.rb` with your server details:
     ```ruby
     server 'your_server_ip', user: 'deploy', roles: %w{app db web}
     ```

4. Set up SSH access:
   - Generate an SSH key pair on your local machine (if you haven't already)
   - Copy the public key to your server: `ssh-copy-id deploy@your_server_ip`

5. Configure the server:
   - Create the necessary directories on the server:
     ```
     mkdir -p /path/to/deploy/directory/shared/config
     mkdir -p /path/to/deploy/directory/shared/log
     mkdir -p /path/to/deploy/directory/shared/tmp/pids
     mkdir -p /path/to/deploy/directory/shared/tmp/sockets
     ```
   - Create a `.env` file in `/path/to/deploy/directory/shared` with your app's environment variables

6. Configure Nginx:
   - Create a new Nginx configuration file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/your_app_name`
   - Add the necessary server block configuration for your app
   - Symlink the configuration file to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`
   - Restart Nginx: `sudo systemctl restart nginx`

7. Deploy the app:
   - Run `cap production deploy` to deploy your app to the server
   - If the deployment fails, check the Capistrano log for errors and resolve them

8. Start the app:
   - SSH into your server: `ssh deploy@your_server_ip`
   - Navigate to the current release directory: `cd /path/to/deploy/directory/current`
   - Start the Rails server (e.g., using Puma or Unicorn): `bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb`

9. Visit your app's URL in a web browser to verify the deployment.

Note: This is a high-level overview of the deployment process. You may need to modify the steps based on your specific application's requirements and server setup. Additionally, you may want to consider using a process manager like systemd or Supervisor to manage your Rails server process.

You're absolutely right! Capistrano provides tasks and mechanisms to automate the server configuration process. Instead of manually creating directories and configuring the server, you can leverage Capistrano's built-in tasks and define custom tasks to handle these steps.

Here's an updated version of the deployment steps that utilizes Capistrano tasks:

1. Set up the server:
   - Install necessary dependencies: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git nodejs postgresql libpq-dev nginx`
   - Install Ruby (e.g., using rbenv or rvm)
   - Install Bundler: `gem install bundler`
   - Configure PostgreSQL and create a database for your app

2. Set up the Rails app:
   - Add the Capistrano gem to your Gemfile: `gem 'capistrano', '~> 3.11'`
   - Run `bundle install`
   - Run `cap install` to generate Capistrano configuration files

3. Configure Capistrano:
   - Open `Capfile` and uncomment the necessary Capistrano modules (e.g., `capistrano/rails`, `capistrano/bundler`, `capistrano/rbenv` or `capistrano/rvm`)
   - Update `config/deploy.rb` with your app's details:
     ```ruby
     set :application, 'your_app_name'
     set :repo_url, 'git@github.com:username/repo.git'
     set :deploy_to, '/path/to/deploy/directory'
     set :branch, 'main'
     ```
   - Update `config/deploy/production.rb` with your server details:
     ```ruby
     server 'your_server_ip', user: 'deploy', roles: %w{app db web}
     ```

4. Set up SSH access:
   - Generate an SSH key pair on your local machine (if you haven't already)
   - Copy the public key to your server: `ssh-copy-id deploy@your_server_ip`

5. Define Capistrano tasks:
   - In `config/deploy.rb`, define tasks to create the necessary directories and configure the server:
     ```ruby
     namespace :deploy do
       desc 'Create shared directories'
       task :create_shared_directories do
         on roles(:app) do
           execute "mkdir -p #{shared_path}/config"
           execute "mkdir -p #{shared_path}/log"
           execute "mkdir -p #{shared_path}/tmp/pids"
           execute "mkdir -p #{shared_path}/tmp/sockets"
         end
       end
     end

     before 'deploy:check', 'deploy:create_shared_directories'
     ```
   - You can also define tasks to handle other server configuration steps, such as creating the `.env` file or configuring Nginx.

6. Deploy the app:
   - Run `cap production deploy` to deploy your app to the server
   - Capistrano will automatically create the necessary directories and perform the configured tasks during the deployment process

7. Start the app:
   - Capistrano can be configured to automatically start the Rails server after deployment
   - You can define a custom task in `config/deploy.rb` to start the server using Puma or Unicorn

8. Visit your app's URL in a web browser to verify the deployment.

By leveraging Capistrano tasks, you can automate the server configuration steps and streamline the deployment process. Capistrano provides a rich set of built-in tasks and allows you to define custom tasks to handle specific setup and configuration requirements for your application.

Remember to adjust the tasks and configurations based on your application's specific needs and server environment.

Capistrano provides a set of built-in tasks that you can use out of the box. These tasks cover common deployment steps and can be customized or extended based on your specific requirements. Here are some of the key built-in tasks provided by Capistrano:

1. `deploy`: The main task that performs the entire deployment process. It includes sub-tasks like `deploy:starting`, `deploy:updating`, `deploy:publishing`, `deploy:finishing`, and `deploy:finishing_rollback`.

2. `deploy:check`: Checks if the required dependencies and directories are present on the server before deployment.

3. `deploy:setup`: Sets up the basic directory structure on the server for deployment.

4. `deploy:symlink`: Creates symlinks for shared directories and files.

5. `deploy:update`: Updates the application code on the server by cloning the repository and updating the symlinks.

6. `deploy:rollback`: Rolls back to the previous release in case of deployment failures.

7. `deploy:restart`: Restarts the application server.

8. `deploy:start`: Starts the application server.

9. `deploy:stop`: Stops the application server.

10. `deploy:cleanup`: Cleans up old releases to keep the deployment directory clean.

11. `deploy:assets:precompile`: Precompiles the assets (CSS, JavaScript) for production.

12. `deploy:migrate`: Runs database migrations.

13. `deploy:seed`: Runs database seed data.

14. `deploy:pending`: Shows pending commits that will be deployed.

15. `deploy:log_revision`: Logs the current revision being deployed.

16. `ssh`: Opens an SSH session to the server.

17. `console`: Opens an interactive console on the server.

These are just a few examples of the built-in tasks provided by Capistrano. Capistrano also integrates with other libraries and plugins, such as `capistrano/bundler`, `capistrano/rails`, `capistrano/rbenv`, and `capistrano/puma`, which provide additional tasks specific to those libraries.

You can list all available tasks by running `cap -T` in your terminal. This command will display a list of tasks along with their descriptions.

Additionally, you can define your own custom tasks in your `config/deploy.rb` file or in separate task files within the `lib/capistrano/tasks` directory. Custom tasks allow you to extend and customize the deployment process to suit your application's specific needs.

Remember to consult the Capistrano documentation (https://capistranorb.com/) for more detailed information on available tasks, configuration options, and customization possibilities.

The `deploy:setup` task in Capistrano is responsible for setting up the basic directory structure on the server for deployment. When you run `cap deploy:setup`, Capistrano connects to the server and creates the necessary directories and permissions required for deploying your application.

Here's what the `deploy:setup` task typically does:

1. Creates the deployment directory: Capistrano creates the main deployment directory on the server based on the `:deploy_to` configuration variable. For example, if `:deploy_to` is set to `/var/www/my_app`, Capistrano will create this directory if it doesn't already exist.

2. Creates subdirectories: Inside the deployment directory, Capistrano creates several subdirectories used during the deployment process. These subdirectories usually include:
   - `current/`: A symlink that points to the current release of your application.
   - `releases/`: Contains subdirectories for each deployed release of your application.
   - `shared/`: Contains files and directories that are shared across releases, such as configuration files, logs, and uploaded files.

3. Sets permissions: Capistrano sets the appropriate permissions on the created directories to ensure that the deployment user has the necessary read, write, and execute permissions.

Here's an example of what the `deploy:setup` task might look like in the Capistrano deployment flow:

```
.
├── current -> /var/www/my_app/releases/20210623101023
├── releases
│   ├── 20210623101023
│   └── 20210623101024
└── shared
    ├── config
    ├── log
    ├── public
    │   └── uploads
    └── tmp
        └── pids
```

In this example, the `deploy:setup` task created the main deployment directory (`/var/www/my_app`) along with the `current`, `releases`, and `shared` subdirectories. The `shared` directory contains subdirectories for configuration files, logs, uploaded files, and temporary files.

It's worth noting that the `deploy:setup` task is typically run only once, when you first set up the deployment environment on the server. In subsequent deployments, Capistrano assumes that the basic directory structure is already in place and proceeds with the deployment process.

If you need to customize the `deploy:setup` task or add additional setup steps, you can define your own tasks or extend the existing `deploy:setup` task in your `config/deploy.rb` file.

Remember to run `cap deploy:setup` before running your first deployment to ensure that the necessary directory structure is created on the server.

By default, Capistrano does not automatically create the `database.yml` and `master.key` files on the server. These files often contain sensitive information, such as database credentials and encryption keys, so it's generally recommended to manage them separately and securely.

However, Capistrano provides mechanisms to handle the deployment of these files securely. Here are a couple of common approaches:

1. Symlink shared files:
   - Create the `database.yml` and `master.key` files locally on your machine.
   - Add these files to your `.gitignore` to prevent them from being versioned in your Git repository.
   - Upload these files to the server manually or using a secure file transfer mechanism (e.g., SCP, SFTP) to a specific directory within the `shared` directory, such as `shared/config`.
   - In your `config/deploy.rb` file, specify the paths to these files using the `set :linked_files` configuration:
     ```ruby
     set :linked_files, %w{config/database.yml config/master.key}
     ```
   - During deployment, Capistrano will create symlinks from the `current` directory to the corresponding files in the `shared` directory.

2. Use environment variables:
   - Instead of relying on physical files, you can store the sensitive information as environment variables on the server.
   - Set up environment variables on the server using a tool like `dotenv` or by manually exporting them in the server's configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.profile`).
   - In your Rails application, update the configuration to read the values from environment variables instead of files.
   - Capistrano will not need to manage the `database.yml` and `master.key` files in this case.

Regardless of the approach you choose, it's important to ensure that sensitive information is properly secured and not exposed in plain text or version control.

If you decide to use the symlink approach, you can add tasks to your `config/deploy.rb` file to handle the creation of the symlinks during deployment:

```ruby
namespace :deploy do
  namespace :check do
    before :linked_files, :set_master_key do
      on roles(:app), in: :sequence, wait: 10 do
        unless test("[ -f #{shared_path}/config/master.key ]")
          upload! 'config/master.key', "#{shared_path}/config/master.key"
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

In this example, the task checks if the `master.key` file exists in the `shared/config` directory on the server. If it doesn't exist, it uploads the local `master.key` file to the server.

Remember to adapt these approaches based on your specific security requirements and deployment setup. It's crucial to handle sensitive files and information securely throughout the deployment process.

Yes, the `deploy:setup` task is typically run automatically as part of the `cap production deploy` command, but only if the setup has not been previously performed.

When you run `cap production deploy`, Capistrano executes a sequence of tasks defined in the deployment flow. The `deploy:setup` task is usually included in this flow and is run before the actual deployment tasks.

However, Capistrano is designed to be idempotent, meaning that running the same task multiple times should produce the same result without causing conflicts or duplications. If the `deploy:setup` task has already been run and the necessary directory structure is in place on the server, Capistrano will skip the setup task and proceed with the rest of the deployment process.

The typical deployment flow in Capistrano looks like this:

1. `deploy:starting`: Announces that the deployment is starting.
2. `deploy:check:directories`: Checks if the required directories exist on the server.
3. `deploy:check:linked_dirs`: Checks if the linked directories are set up correctly.
4. `deploy:check:make_linked_dirs`: Creates any missing linked directories.
5. `deploy:check:linked_files`: Checks if the linked files are set up correctly.
6. `deploy:setup`: Sets up the basic directory structure on the server (if not already done).
7. `deploy:symlink:shared`: Creates symlinks for shared files and directories.
8. `deploy:update`: Updates the application code on the server.
9. `deploy:publishing`: Makes the new release the current release.
10. `deploy:finishing`: Performs finishing tasks, such as restarting the application server.
11. `deploy:finished`: Announces that the deployment is finished.

The `deploy:setup` task is part of this flow and is executed before the actual deployment tasks. If the setup has already been done, Capistrano will skip it and move on to the subsequent tasks.

You can customize the deployment flow by adding, removing, or modifying tasks in your `config/deploy.rb` file. If you need to force the `deploy:setup` task to run every time, you can explicitly invoke it before the deployment tasks:

```ruby
namespace :deploy do
  before :starting, :setup do
    invoke 'deploy:setup'
  end
end
```

This will ensure that the `deploy:setup` task is always run before the deployment starts, even if it has been previously executed.

Remember to review your deployment process and configure it according to your application's specific requirements and server setup.

Yes, the provided responses for Capistrano questions are applicable to Capistrano version 3. Capistrano 3 introduced some changes and improvements compared to previous versions, but the overall concepts and workflow remain similar.

Capistrano 3 brought several notable changes, including:

1. New directory structure: Capistrano 3 follows a new directory structure for deployments. The default deployment path is `current/` instead of `current/` being a symlink to the latest release.

2. Configuration using DSL: Capistrano 3 uses a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for configuration in the `config/deploy.rb` file and environment-specific files in `config/deploy/`.

3. Modular structure: Capistrano 3 introduced a modular structure where you can load specific modules and plugins based on your requirements. Plugins are added as gems in the `Gemfile` and loaded in the `Capfile`.

4. Namespace changes: Some of the built-in task namespaces were changed in Capistrano 3. For example, `deploy:setup` is now `deploy:check`.

5. Linked files and directories: Capistrano 3 introduced the concept of linked files and directories, which allows you to specify files and directories that should be symlinked from the `shared/` directory to each release directory.

Despite these changes, the general principles and deployment workflow remain similar to previous versions of Capistrano. The responses provided earlier are still applicable to Capistrano 3, with minor adjustments to account for the new directory structure and configuration syntax.

Here are a few examples of how the previous responses would be adapted for Capistrano 3:

- Setting linked files and directories:
  ```ruby
  # Capistrano 3
  set :linked_files, %w{config/database.yml config/master.key}
  set :linked_dirs, %w{log tmp/pids tmp/cache tmp/sockets vendor/bundle public/system}
  ```

- Customizing deployment tasks:
  ```ruby
  # Capistrano 3
  namespace :deploy do
    namespace :check do
      before :linked_files, :set_master_key do
        on roles(:app), in: :sequence, wait: 10 do
          unless test("[ -f #{shared_path}/config/master.key ]")
            upload! 'config/master.key', "#{shared_path}/config/master.key"
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
  ```

The deployment flow and tasks mentioned earlier are still relevant to Capistrano 3, with some namespace changes (e.g., `deploy:setup` is now `deploy:check`).

When working with Capistrano 3, make sure to refer to the Capistrano 3 documentation (https://capistranorb.com/) for detailed information on the new directory structure, configuration syntax, and available tasks and plugins.

Overall, the concepts and principles discussed in the previous responses are applicable to Capistrano 3, with minor adjustments to align with the version-specific changes.
